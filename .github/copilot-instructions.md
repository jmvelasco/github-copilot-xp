# Rules:
Always use spanish to respond me
Always write test first (Red-Green-Refactor)
Use TPP transformations for simplest implementation
No mocks without approval
YAGNI principle strictly
Refactor after each green test
Please help me follow TDD cycle starting with the failing test when I begin implementation.
If you add TODO notes in the test files to track the pending test cases ensure you update the status once it is validated
