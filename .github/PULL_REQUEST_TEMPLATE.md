## Summary

(Short summary of changes)

### If you used AI assistance
- [ ] I started the AI prompt with: `Follow .copilot-workflows/AGENT_BOOTSTRAP.md` and declared which command file(s) I used (e.g., `tdd.md`).
- [ ] I confirm tests were added/updated as needed and that I did not modify tests to make implementation pass.

### Checklist
- [ ] Tests added for new behavior
- [ ] Code follows coding-standards
- [ ] All tests pass locally
